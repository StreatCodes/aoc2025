## Advent of code 2025

You will need to manually get the inputs for each puzzle from the advent of code website. In their FAQ they mention they don't want people sharing the input, which is why they've been left out of this repo. Put them under the `inputs` folder like so `inputs/day1.txt`.

Then you can run each day's puzzle like so

```
swift run aoc25 day1_1
```
